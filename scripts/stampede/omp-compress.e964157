icx: warning: Use of '-qopenmp' recommended over '-fopenmp' [-Wrecommended-option]
icx: remark: Note that use of '-g' without any optimization-level option will turn off most compiler optimizations similar to use of '-O0'; use '-Rno-debug-disables-optimization' to disable this remark [-Rdebug-disables-optimization]
